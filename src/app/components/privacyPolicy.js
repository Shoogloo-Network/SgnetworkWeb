          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm my-2">
            Shoogloo Network uses Trackier for pixel or server post back
            tracking to collect information about users. Pixel tracking (also
            called “cookie-based tracking” and “client-side tracking”) methods
            store a Trackier session identifier in a user’s browser cookie on
            click. In post back tracking (also called “server-side tracking”),
            Trackier directly sends a session identifier to the advertiser on
            click. On conversion, the advertiser then communicates that
            identifier to Trackier for validation. Trackier also supports
            server-to-server measurement for some clients. With any of the
            mentioned methods, when an end-user clicks on an advertisement, goes
            to a specific web page or mobile app action that is being monitored,
            Trackier collects information from the user’s computer or device,
            including but not limited to IP and Ad Identifiers.

            User can disable cookies in most internet browsers. Disabling

            end-user would like to opt-out of a particular ad network,
            publisher, or advertiser’s ads, they will need to contact those
            companies directly to inquire whether they have an opt-out option.
            End users can also disable the collection of Ad Identifiers for
            targeted advertising by enabling the Limit Ad Tracking setting on
            their smartphone. End users can also reset the Ad Identifier
            altogether using their smartphone’s privacy settings.
